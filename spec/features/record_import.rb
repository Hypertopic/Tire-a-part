These architectures raise issues about the administrative control, maintenance and management of the central entity. In this paper, we present a new architecture based on peer-to-peer (P2P) model driven by user relationship. In our architecture, users choose the trusted co-workers they are connected with. Thus, only the most trusted users manage to obtain a high number of connections which grant them a relative authority inside the system.
