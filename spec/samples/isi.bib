Abstract = {{While systems for collaborative distributed works focus on enhancing
   distributed work group productivity, little attention has been paid to
   their architecture. In fact, most of these systems rely on centralized
   ones for both user communications and data hosting. These architectures
   raise issues about the administrative control, maintenance and
   management of the central entity. In this paper, we present a new
   architecture based on peer-to-peer (P2P) model driven by user
   relationship. In our architecture, users choose the trusted co-workers
   they are connected with. Thus, only the most trusted users manage to
   obtain a high number of connections which grant them a relative
   authority inside the system.}},
